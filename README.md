Create executable demo documents that show and prove an agent's work.

Showboat helps agents build markdown documents that mix commentary, executable code blocks, and captured output. These documents serve as both readable documentation and reproducible proof of work. A verifier can re-execute all code blocks and confirm the outputs still match.

## Example

Here's [an example Showboat demo document](https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/shot-scraper/README.md) that demonstrates [shot-scraper](https://github.com/shot-scraper). It was created by Claude Code, as shown by [this transcript](https://gisthost.github.io/?29b0d0ebef50c57e7985a6004aad01c4/page-001.html#msg-2026-02-06T07-33-41-296Z).

## Installation

This Go tool can be installed directly [from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/showboat/) using `pip` or `uv`.

You can run it without installing it first using `uvx`:

```bash
uvx showboat --help
```
Or install it like this, then run `showboat --help`:
```bash
uv tool install showboat
# or
pip install showboat
```

You can also install the Go binary directly:
```bash
go install github.com/simonw/showboat@latest
```
Or run it without installation like this:
```bash
go run github.com/simonw/showboat@latest --help
```
Compiled binaries are available [on the releases page](https://github.com/simonw/showboat/releases). On macOS you may need to [follow these extra steps](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445) to use those.

showboat - Create executable demo documents that show and prove an agent's work.

Showboat helps agents build markdown documents that mix commentary, executable
code blocks, and captured output. These documents serve as both readable
documentation and reproducible proof of work. A verifier can re-execute all
code blocks and confirm the outputs still match.

Usage:
  showboat init <file> <title>             Create a new demo document
  showboat note <file> [text]              Append commentary (text or stdin)
  showboat exec <file> <lang> [code]       Run code and capture output
  showboat image <file> [script]           Run script, capture image output
  showboat pop <file>                      Remove the most recent entry
  showboat verify <file> [--output <new>]  Re-run and diff all code blocks
  showboat extract <file> [--filename <name>]  Emit commands to recreate file

Global Options:
  --workdir <dir>   Set working directory for code execution (default: current)
  --version         Print version and exit
  --help, -h        Show this help message

Exec output:
  The "exec" command prints the captured shell output to stdout and exits with
  the same exit code as the executed command. This lets agents see what happened
  and react to errors. The output is still appended to the document regardless
  of exit code. Use "pop" to remove a failed entry.

    $ showboat exec demo.md bash "echo hello && exit 1"
    hello
    $ echo $?
    1

Image:
  The "image" command runs a script that is expected to produce an image file.
  The image is saved in the same directory as the document and an image reference
  is appended to the markdown. The script is recorded as a bash code block.

Pop:
  The "pop" command removes the most recent entry from a document. For an "exec"
  or "image" entry this removes both the code block and its output. For a "note"
  entry it removes the single commentary block. This is useful when a command
  produces an error that shouldn't remain in the document.

Verify:
  Re-runs every code block (skipping image blocks) and compares actual output
  against the recorded output. Prints diffs and exits with code 1 if any output
  has changed; exits 0 if everything matches. Use --output <file> to write an
  updated copy of the document with the new outputs without modifying the
  original.

Extract:
  Parses a document and prints the sequence of showboat CLI commands (one per
  line) that would recreate it from scratch. Output blocks are omitted since
  they are regenerated by "exec". Use --filename <name> to substitute a
  different filename in the emitted commands.

Stdin:
  Commands accept input from stdin when the text/code argument is omitted.
  For example:
    echo "Hello world" | showboat note demo.md
    cat script.sh | showboat exec demo.md bash

Example:
  # Create a demo
  showboat init demo.md "Setting Up a Python Project"

  # Add commentary
  showboat note demo.md "First, let's create a virtual environment."

  # Run a command and capture output (output is printed to stdout)
  showboat exec demo.md bash "python3 -m venv .venv && echo 'Done'"

  # Run Python and capture output
  showboat exec demo.md python "print('Hello from Python')"

  # Oops, wrong command — remove the last entry from the document
  showboat pop demo.md

  # Redo it correctly
  showboat exec demo.md python3 "print('Hello from Python')"

  # Capture a screenshot
  showboat image demo.md "python screenshot.py http://localhost:8000"

  # Verify the demo still works
  showboat verify demo.md

  # See what commands built the demo
  showboat extract demo.md

Resulting markdown format:

  # Setting Up a Python Project

  *2026-02-06T15:30:00Z*

  First, let's create a virtual environment.

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv .venv && echo 'Done'
  ```

  ```output
  Done
  ```

  ```python3
  print('Hello from Python')
  ```

  ```output
  Hello from Python
  ```

  ```bash
  python screenshot.py http://localhost:8000
  ```

````
<!-- [[[end]]] -->

## Example

```bash
# Create a demo
showboat init demo.md "Setting Up a Python Project"

# Add commentary
showboat note demo.md "First, let's create a virtual environment."

# Run a command and capture output
showboat exec demo.md bash "python3 -m venv .venv && echo 'Done'"

# Run Python and capture output
showboat exec demo.md python "print('Hello from Python')"

# Capture a screenshot
showboat image demo.md "python screenshot.py http://localhost:8000"
```

This produces a markdown file like:

````markdown
# Setting Up a Python Project

*2026-02-06T15:30:00Z*

First, let's create a virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && echo 'Done'
```

```output
Done
```

```python
print('Hello from Python')
```

```output
Hello from Python
```
````

## Verifying

`showboat verify` re-executes every code block in a document and checks that the outputs still match:

```bash
showboat verify demo.md
```

## Extracting

`showboat extract` emits the sequence of commands that would recreate a document from scratch:

```bash
showboat extract demo.md
```

For the example above this would output:

```
showboat init demo.md 'Setting Up a Python Project'
showboat note demo.md 'First, let'\''s create a virtual environment.'
showboat exec demo.md bash 'python3 -m venv .venv && echo '\''Done'\'''
showboat exec demo.md python 'print('\''Hello from Python'\'')'
```

By default the commands reference the original filename. Use `--filename` to substitute a different filename in the emitted commands:

```bash
showboat extract demo.md --filename copy.md
```

## Building the Python wheels

The Python wheel versions are built using [go-to-wheel](https://github.com/simonw/go-to-wheel):

```bash
uvx go-to-wheel . \
  --readme README.md \
  --description "Create executable documents that demonstrate an agent's work" \
  --author 'Simon Willison' \
  --license Apache-2.0 \
  --url https://github.com/simonw/showboat \
  --set-version-var main.version \
  --version 0.1.0
```
